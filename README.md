# Solvd React Laba Argentina 2022

This repository contains all information about the lectures and serves as a central repository to submit all your class works.

## Structure
You need to create a folder in the `homeworks` folder. The name should be `firstName-lastName`. E.g. for a developer Mykhailo Melnyk the name would be `mykhailo-melnyk`. The Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.

## Pull Requests
### Naming
Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for a developer Mykhailo Melnyk prefix would be `mm-`. In case of prefix collisions in the future the common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: `mmel-`.

### Reviews
Once PR is created you have to do the following things:

- Assign your mentor as a reviewer
- Ping the mentor about the PR ;)
